###Download the latest pre-built Windows Bridge for iOS SDK [here](https://aka.ms/winobjc_latest).

**Note on installing the bridge:** We use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) to handle the large binaries included in the bridge. This does not affect using the [prebuilt releases found on our releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/releases). If you build the bridge from source, please see the instructions found on our [Building From Source](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Building-From-Source) wiki page.

**Do not use the Download ZIP via the "Download or Clone" option above.** You will not be able to build the bridge using the resulting .zip file. See ["I'm getting errors after downloading the bridge through the "Download ZIP" button on Github. What should I do?"](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/FAQ#im-getting-errors-after-downloading-the-bridge-through-the-download-zip-button-on-github-what-should-i-do) for more information.

# Welcome to the Windows Bridge for iOS project preview
The Windows Bridge for iOS (also referred to as WinObjC) is a Microsoft open-source project that provides an Objective-C development environment for Visual Studio and support for iOS APIs. The bridge allows you to create Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that will run on many Windows devices using iOS APIs and Objective-C code alongside Windows 10 features like Cortana and Live Tiles.


## Where to get the bridge

## Resources
The following sections will help you get started. For more information, check out:

1. [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki)
2. [Development roadmap](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Roadmap)
3. [Website on Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com/bridges/ios)
4. [Quick Start Challenge](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Quick-Start-Tutorial)

If you'd like to support the project, please consider [submitting your app](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/bridges/ios/app-submission) to help us test our app analysis tool. You can read more about the effort and what we're working on [here](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/11/18/windows-bridge-for-ios-where-we-are-and-where-we-are-headed/).


## Getting started with the bridge
To get started using the bridge to bring your iOS app to Windows, you'll need:
- Windows 10, build 10586 or higher. (Validate your version number [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/which-operating-system)).
- Visual Studio 2015 with Windows developer tools. Visual Studio 2015 Community is available for free [here](https://dev.windows.com/downloads). Select (at least) the following components during installation:

    1. Programming Languages -> Visual C++
    2. Universal Windows App Development Tools (all)

- (Optional) Windows 10 1511 Standalone SDK (Updated on November 30th, 2015) from [here](https://dev.windows.com/en-US/downloads/windows-10-sdk).  Note: this step is new and is not required if you already installed Visual Studio 2015 Update 1.

The best way to get started with the bridge is to run one of the samples. We recommend starting with the **WOCCatalog** sample app, which demonstrates an assortment of iOS and XAML UI controls.

**NOTE:** The following instructions are for getting started using the ***pre-built SDK*** rather than building the SDK from source. If you're building the SDK from the source code, follow the instructions on the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki) instead. 

To run the sample:

1. Extract the SDK zip file to a local directory
2. Navigate to *winobjc/samples/WOCCatalog* in the extracted directory
3. Double-click on *WOCCatalog-WinStore10.sln* to open in VS2015
4. In VS2015 right-click on the WOCCatalog (Universal Windows) project
5. Select **Set as StartUp project**
6. Use **Ctrl-F5** to build and run the app
